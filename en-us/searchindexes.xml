Night shadows fall on frosty panes so cold, With scrolls in hand, to dreamland I&amp;rsquo;m consoled. Through years of wind and snow, rain&amp;rsquo;s endless beat, Beneath the candlelight, my tea grows sweet. Like scholars hanging beams and pricking thighs with pain,
The student toils through night and day again. Ambition drives for fame and worldly gain, Longing afar to be top scholar&amp;rsquo;s reign.
